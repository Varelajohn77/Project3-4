                        <p>One project that I made during an intro to engineering class was a stirling engine.</p><br>
                        <p>A Stirling engine is a heat engine that is operated by the cyclic compression and expansion of air or other gas (the working fluid) between different temperatures, resulting in a net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work.</p>

                                  <p>The stirling engine was invented by a fellow by the name of Robert Stirling. Stirling was born on October 25 1790. He pursued a career as a clergyman and engineer. He patented the Stirling engine in 1816 after several previous attempts at creating an air engine. His patent focused on some parts that kept some residual energy within the system allowing it to require less energy and therefore less fuel. He had also created the engine to compete directly with steam engines which, at the time were relatively dangerous having a tendency to explode when improperly used. Although it had great design and much thought had been put into the engine, the engines Stirling and his brother built tended to be unreliable because of some of the material limitations and the steam engines started becoming more reliable and safer. Stirling stopped pursuing the idea without knowing how it would be used today.</p>
